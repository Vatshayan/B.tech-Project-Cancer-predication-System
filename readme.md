# Prostate Cancer Prediction Using Machine learning 

97 Men Data has been taken that tells about the level of prostate-specfic antigen and also a number of clinical measures 
Study is about the relationship between the prostate-specific antigen (psa) and the clinical measures standing for predictor variables. 

The data frame consists in 97 observations on 8 predictor variables and the response variable (lpsa).

The prediction modelling is achieved with regression models. 

We will applly different regression model on this Data like -

1. Ridge regression
2. Lasso
3. Elastic Net

We will study the influence of regularization on the model.
